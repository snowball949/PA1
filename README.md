Instructions: to implement these files on ubuntu virtual machine you need to go to the correct file path and use an editor to add in the code I have in this repository. Then recompile the kernel.


cs3753_add file path: ./arch/x86/kernel/cs3753_add.c

Makefile file path: ./arch/x86/kernel/Makefile

syscall_64.tbl file path: ./arch/x86/entry/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

syscalls.h file path: ./include/linux/syscalls.h

syscall1.c(test program for helloworld) file path: /home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/syscall1.c

syscall2.c(test program for cs3753_add) file path: /home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/syscall2.c
